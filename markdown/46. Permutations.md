## [46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/description/)
### Tags:
__Backtracking__
### Input:
A collection of __DISTINCT__ numbers i.e. an array
### Output: 
All permutations
```
e.g.
[1,2,3] have the following permutations:
[
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [2,3,1],
  [3,1,2],
  [3,2,1]
]
```
### Basic idea:
* recursion + backtracking
* recursion will do a little bit of job each time when it is called
___
### Pseudo code:
* Important variable declaration and explanation:
	* __chosen:__ a container to record all decisions we have made sofar
* __Base case:__
	* If pool is __empty__, ---> nothing we can chose from pool
		* push "chosen" into our final solution set
* __Recursive case:__
	* __Decison:__ chose a number
	* __Choice:__ each number in pool
	* __Making decision:__ 
		1. decalre a temporary variable __"temp"__ to store the choice we made such that it will be used in "Backtracking";
		2. push the choice into __"chosen"__ to record our decision
		3. pop the choice we made from pool
	* __Explore:__ recursive call
	* __Backtracking:__ 
		1. pop out the choice from __"chosen"__
		2. push the choice we made back into pool at __CORRECT__ position;
___
### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(N!)__
    >Think about it in the following way:
    >The first position: we have N choices
    >The second position: we have N - 1 choices
    >The N-th position: we have only 1 choice;
    >Thus, the number of permutations for a collection of N DISTINCT numbers is N! ---> N Factorail;
* __Spatial:__ stack of function calls

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> permute(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        vector<int> chosen;
        helper(nums, chosen, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    void helper(vector<int>& pool, vector<int>& chosen, vector<vector<int>>& ret)
    {
        if(pool.empty()){
            ret.push_back(chosen);
        } else {
            for(int i = 0; i < pool.size(); i++){
                int choice = pool[i];
                //Making decision
                chosen.push_back(choice);
                pool.erase(pool.begin() + i);
                
                helper(pool, chosen, ret);//explore
                
                //Backtracking
                chosen.pop_back();
                pool.insert(pool.begin() + i, choice);
            }
        }
    }
};
