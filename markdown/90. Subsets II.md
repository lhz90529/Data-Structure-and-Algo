## [90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/description/)
### Tags:
Array, __Backtracking__
### Input:
Given a collection of integers that __might contain duplicates__
### Output:
Return __all possible subsets__ (the power set)
### Constrains:
- The solution set __must not contain duplicate subsets__

### Basic Idea:
- __Sort__ the input array such that duplicates will cluster
- Each time you can chose:
    - __include__ the number in the solution set
    - __or not__ 
- Suppose you are currently accessing element __'a'__, there are two paths to follow
    - include 
    - or not
- However, if the next round you meet another __'a'__ _(i.e. duplicates number)_, and if the last round you chose to include __'a'__, __the only way you path you can follow is to "continue include 'a'__
- Think about in this way:
    - __case1:__ you chose to include __'a'__ in the first round, and chose not to include __'a'__ in the second round
    - __case2:__ you chose not to include __'a'__ in the first round, and chose to include __'a'__ in the second round
    - __Important Observation:__ __case1__ and __case2__ will produce exactly same result, i.e. where does duplicated solution set happen

                                    (aab, " ")
                                  /           \
                            (ab, a)          (ab, " ")
                            /     \          /       \
                        (b, aa)   (b, a) (b, a)    (b," ")
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                 duplicates happen
                                 
### Pseudo Code:
- __Base case:__ when pool is empty
- __Recursive cases__:
    - chose a number from pool
    - Two paths to follow
        - include it
        - or not
    - __Special case__: if the currently accessing element is as same as the last round, the only way we can decision we can make is to include it again

### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(2^N) worst case__ 
* __Spatial: cost on stack taken by recursive calls__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> subsetsWithDup(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        vector<int> chosen;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());//sort
        helper(nums, chosen, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    void helper(vector<int>& pool, vector<int>& chosen, vector<vector<int>>& ret){
        if(pool.empty()){//base case
            ret.push_back(chosen);
        } else {//recursive case
            //select a number
            int target = pool.back();
            pool.pop_back();
            
            //1: take it
            chosen.push_back(target);//make decision
            helper(pool, chosen, ret);//explore
            chosen.pop_back();//backtracking
            
            //2: not take it with special condition
            if(chosen.empty() || chosen.back() != target){
                helper(pool, chosen, ret);//explore
            }
            pool.push_back(target);//backtracking
        }
    }
};
