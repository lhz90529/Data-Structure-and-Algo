## [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/description/)
### Tag:
Array, __Backtracking__
### Input:
int target, An array
### Output: 
__All UNIQUE Combinations__ in input array where the candidate numbers sums to target.
### Constrians: 
* Each number in C may __only be used once__ in the combination
* All numbers (including target) will be __positive__ integers
* The solution set must contain __no duplicate combinations__

### Basic idea:
* Sort the input array such that:
	* duplicate element will be clustered
* recursion + backtracking
___
### Pseudo code:
1. Sort the input array
2. recursion + backtracking
    * Important variable declaration and explanation:
	    * chosen: a container to record all decisions we have made sofar
	    * start: indicate where you can start exploring element from the pool for each recursive call         
	        * Initialization: start = 0 since the first recursive call has access to all elements from the pool

    * Base case: 
	    * if target == 0, i.e. no more work need to do
			* push "chosen" into final solution set  
    * Recursive cases:
	    * For each element from the valid range of the pool, i.e. from "start" to the last element of the pool
		    * __Important check:__
		        * if(i > start && pool[i] == pool[i - 1])
			        * skip this round;
		        * Explanation:
		        > if we are accessing a non-first element, and if the value of current accessing element is as same as that of the previous one, we skip this round to avoid duplicat combination, that's the main reason why we sort the pool before doing recursion

                * end if
		    * __Optimize our choice:__
			    * chose element that is no larger than target
		    * __Making decision:__ push the choice into "chosen";
		    * __Explore:__ making recursive call with differetn parameters:
			    1. target = target - choice;//less job
			    2. start = start + 1;//restrict access
		    * __Backtracking:__ pop out choice from "chosen" ---> i.e. undo the decision we made
    	* End For

        vector<int> chosen;

    void helper(int start, int target, vector<int>& pool, vector<int>& chosen, vector<vector<int>>& ret)

        } else {//recursive case
            for(int i = start; i < pool.size(); i++){
                if(i > start && pool[i] == pool[i-1]){//avoid duplicate combination
                    continue;
                } else {
                    if(pool[i] <= target){//optimize choice
                        chosen.push_back(pool[i]);//making decision
                        helper(i+1, target - pool[i], pool, chosen, ret);//explore
                        chosen.pop_back();//backtracking
                    }
