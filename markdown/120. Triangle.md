## [120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/description/)
### Tags:
Array, Dynamic Programming
### Input:
Given a triangle
### Output:
Find __the minimum path sum from top to bottom__ 
### Constrains:
- _Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below_

### e.g.
    For example, given the following triangle
    [
         [2],
        [3,4],
       [6,5,7],
      [4,1,8,3]
    ]
    The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 11 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11).
### Basic Idea:
- one observation is the i-th level contains `i+1` elements
- ___minimum path sum from top to bottom is equal to minimum path from bottom to top, so we could start from the bottom and climb upward___ ---> we should learn the flexibility to solve problem
> If we cannot  easily solve the problem in this direction, how about takcle it inversely?

- memorize the minimum path sum to reach each position of each level
    - since if we have the minimum path sum to reach each position of level `i`, the minmum path sum to reach each position of level `i-1` can be obtained from that memorized information


### Pseudo Code:
- we start from the bottom
- the minimum path sum to reach each position of the bottom level is just itself
- Climb upward
    - For each point j at current level
        - table[j] = min(table[j], table[j+1]) + the cost of this point
    - End For
- End For

### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(# of elements in the triangle) since we visit each element once__
* __Spatial:O(# of elements of the bottom row)__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumTotal(vector<vector<int>>& triangle) {
        vector<int> table = triangle.back();//construct and initialization  ---> the min cost to reach bottom level
        for (int i = triangle.size() - 2; i >=0; i--) {//climb upward
            for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++) {//for each point at certain level
                table[j] = min(table[j], table[j+1]) + triangle[i][j];//update table
            }
        }
        
        return table.front();
    }
};
```
