## [Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/description/)
### Tags:
Tree, Depth-first-Search
### Input:
Given a binary tree and a sum
### Output:
Find __all__ root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.
### Constrains:
- None

### e.g.
    For example:
    Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
                  5
                 / \
                4   8
               /   / \
              11  13  4
             /  \    / \
            7    2  5   1
    return
    [
       [5,4,11,2],
       [5,8,4,5]
    ]
### Basic Idea:
- __recursion__ + __backtracking__
- Basically saying, the idea is exactly the same as [112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/), except that this time we need to know __what the path is__, instead of simplying determine __if the path is existed__

### Pseudo Code:
- __base case:__
    - _if current visiting node is NULL,_
        - do nothing and simply `return` since there is nothing we can do further
    - else
        - __Make decison:__ 
            - remember the current node ---> put the current node into our path set
        - __special case:__ if the current visiting node is a leaf node, and the amount of work left is equal to the value of current visiting node
            - push the path set into our final solution set;
        - __else ---> i.e. general recursive cases:__
            - go left
            - go right
        - __Backtracking:__
            - pop out the current node from path set

### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(N) since we traverse the whole tree__
* __Spatial:cost of stack taken by recursive calls__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        vector<int> chosen;
        helper(root, sum, chosen, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
private:
    void helper(TreeNode* current, int work, vector<int>& chosen, vector<vector<int>>& ret ){
        if (current == NULL) {
            return;
        } else {
            chosen.push_back(current->val);//making decision
            if (current->left == NULL && current->right == NULL && current->val == work) {//desired path found
                ret.push_back(chosen);
            } else {
                helper(current->left, work - current->val, chosen, ret);//go left
                helper(current->right, work - current->val, chosen, ret);//go right
            }
            chosen.pop_back();//undo
        }
    }

};
