## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)
### Tags:
Hash Table, Two Pointers, String
### Input:
Given a string
### Output:
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
### Constrains:
- None

### e.g.
    Examples:
    Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
    Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

### Basic Idea:
- ___Important Concept___
    - __`sliding window`__
- sliding window will always cover substring without duplication character
- we slide the window through the string, keep caculate its length and update if need

### Pseudo Code:
- __Important Parameters___
    - `set:` use to keep track of characters covered by window
    - `start:` the start of window
    - `end:` the end of window
    - `size of window:` `end` - `start` + 1 __also__ equal to `size of set`
    
- Initialize window start at 0, end at 0
    - here the window just contains the first character in the string
- as long as the window has not reached the end of the string
    - check if the newly discovered character is duplicated,
        - if it is,
            - remove the duplicated char from set
            - increment start by 1
        - else ---> new char
            - insert it into set
            - get size of window and update if need
            - increment end by 1
- window reach the end of string

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal: O(N)__
- __Spatial: O(the length of the longest substring without duplicated characters)__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_set<char> table;
        int start = 0, end = 0;// start and end construct a sliding window ---> key concept for this problem
        int ret = 0;
        while (end < s.length()) {
            if (table.find(s[end]) == table.end()) {//new char
                table.insert(s[end]);
                ret = max(ret, (int)table.size());
                //cout<<s.substr(start, end- start+1)<<endl;
                end++;//extend window size by 1
            } else {//duplicated
                table.erase(s[start++]);//shrink window size by 1
            }
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
