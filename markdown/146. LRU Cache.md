## [146. LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/description/)
### Tags:
Design
### Input:
None
### Output:
Design and implement a data structure for __Least Recently Used (LRU) cache__. It should support the following operations: `get` and `put`.
- `get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
- `put(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

### Constrains:
- _Could you do both operations in __O(1)__ time complexity?_

### Basic Idea:
- __Let's start with interpreting what `get(key)` and `put(key,value)` does__
    1. __What `get(key)` does__
        - search key, if key is found
            - update the temporal info of this `<key,value>` pair ---> make it most recently used
            - return its corresponding value
        - else// don't find the key
            - return -1
		- Basically, two operations are involved in `get(key)`
			1. __search__ 
			2. __update temporal info__
    2. __Now, let's turn our attention to `put(key,value)`__
        - search key, if key is found
            - update its correponding value
            - update temporal info ---> make it most recently used
        - else ---> completely new key
			- if Cache is full already
                - remove the least recently used item
			- add the `<key, value>` pair and mark it as most rencently used
		- Similarly, four operations involved in `put(key, value>`
			1. __search on key__
			2. __update temporal info__
			3. __add new item__
			4. __remove item__
- Thus, here are operations involved in this problem:
    - search key
    - update temporal info (mark any item as most rencently used)
    - add new item (such that it's the most rencently used item)
    - remove item (remove the least recently used item)
    - __ALL operations above should be done in O(1)__
- __What data structure can be used to achieve O(1) search?__
    - Apparently, ___the only choice___ ---> hash table;
    - _Some one may tempt to say that hash table can also provide O(1) insertion  and O(1) deletion, it seems that hash table is all we need_
    - Yes hash table O(1) insertion and O(1) deletion is useful since we can update hash table in O(1). __However soly relying on hash table is not enough, since hash table store no temporal info__ (i.e. hash table has no idea either who is the most rencently used or who is the least recently used) since hash table is an unordered container.
- __Now our problem turns into what data structure can be used to emulate the temporal behavior? i.e.__
    - what data structure can be used to keep track the most recently used item and the least recently used item?
    - __The answer is Linked-List__

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:O(1) since all methods are done in O(1)__
- __Spatial:O(Capacity)__

### Code:
```c++
class LRUCache {
public:
    LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this->capacity = capacity;
    }
    
    int get(int key) {
        unordered_map<int, list<pair<int,int>>::iterator>::iterator it = table.find(key);
        if (it != table.end()) {//find key
            touch(it->second);
            table[key] = mylist.begin();
            return table[key]->second;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    void put(int key, int value) {
        unordered_map<int, list<pair<int,int>>::iterator>::iterator it = table.find(key);
        if (it != table.end()) {//find key, and update value
            it->second->second = value;
            touch(it->second);
            table[key] = mylist.begin();
        } else {//new <key, value> pair
            if (isFull()) {
                removeLRU();
            }
            mylist.push_front({key,value});
            table[key] = mylist.begin();
        }
    }
    
private:
    int capacity;
    list<pair<int,int>> mylist;//list of <key, value>
    unordered_map<int, list<pair<int,int>>::iterator> table;//<key, iterator to the node>
    
    bool isFull() {//return true if Cache reach it's capacity
        return mylist.size() == capacity;
    }
    
    void touch(list<pair<int,int>>::iterator it) {//update temporal info 
        if (it != mylist.begin()) {
            pair<int,int> temp = *it;
            mylist.erase(it); 
            mylist.push_front(temp);
        }
    }

    void removeLRU() {//remove the least recently used item
        int deleteKey = mylist.back().first;
        table.erase(deleteKey);
        mylist.pop_back();
    }
};
