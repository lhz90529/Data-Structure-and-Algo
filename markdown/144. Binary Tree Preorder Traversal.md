## [144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/description/)
### Tags:
Stack, Tree
### Input:
Given a binary tree
### Output:
return its preorder traversal
### Constrains:
- _Can you do it both recursively and iteratively?_

### Basic Idea:
- __What is preorder traversal?__
    - for each node in the tree 
        1. visit the node
        2. visit its left-child
        3. visit its right-child
- Recursive solution is _trivial_
- __We will focus on iterative solution__
    - ___key concept___: _using stack to save those works that you cannot do right away_
    - Each time you visit a node, push its right child first and then push its left child into stack such that left child will be always accessed before right child. 

### Pseudo Code:
- Construct a stack
- push the root node into stack
- while( the stack is not empty)
    - retrive the node on the top of the stack
    - if this is not `NULL` node,
        - visit it
        - push its right child into stack
        - push its left child into stack
- end while

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal: O(N) since visit all nodes__
- __Spatial: O(logN)__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> preorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<int> ret;
        stack<TreeNode*> mystack;
        mystack.push(root);
        TreeNode* current;
        while (!mystack.empty()) {
            current = mystack.top();
            mystack.pop();
            if (current != NULL) {
                ret.push_back(current->val);
                mystack.push(current->right);
                mystack.push(current->left);
            } 
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
