## [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)
### Tag: 
Array, __Backtracking__
### Input: 
A target number, and an array of number that contains __NO DUPLICATE__ 
### Output: 
Find all __UNIQUE__ combinations in array where the candidate numbers sums to target
### Constrains:
1. Each number can be used __multiple times__ in one solution
2. All numbers (including target) will be __positive__ integers
3. The solution set must contain __no duplicate combinations__
___
### Basic idea:
* Key concept: __recursion + backtracking__;
* General structure:
    * recursion:
	    * base case: target == 0 ---> we find the desired combination, push it into final return;
	* recursive cases:
		* __decision:__ chose a number from pool and insert it into solution set
		* __choices of decision:__ each number from the pool with constrain
			* __Optimize our choice__: we only chose the number that is no larger than target, otherwise we are doing useless work;
		* __Making decision:__ push the number into solution set;
		* __Explore__ the path followed by the decision we just made by making recursive call
			* __BUT!!!__ ---> with different parameters:
				1. target = target - decision we just made
				2. tell the next recursive call such that the next recursive call has restricted access to the pool such that duplicate combination will be avoided; **very important && common mistakes**
		* __Backtracking__(_undo the decision we made_): pop out the number from the solution set;
___
### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: maybe O(2^N)__, but this is maybe the best we can do
* __Spatial:__ stack of functions call

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& candidates, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> ret;
        vector<int> chosen;
        helper(target, 0,  candidates, chosen, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    
    void helper(int target, int start, vector<int>& pool, vector<int>& chosen, vector<vector<int>> &ret)
    {
        if(target == 0){//base case
            ret.push_back(chosen);
        }else{//recursive case
            for(int i = start; i < pool.size(); i++){
                if(pool[i] <= target){
                    chosen.push_back(pool[i]);
                    helper(target - pool[i], i, pool, chosen, ret);
                    chosen.pop_back();
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
