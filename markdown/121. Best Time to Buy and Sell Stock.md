### Input:
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i
### Output:
Find the maximum profit.
### Constrains:
- only one buy and one sell is allowed
- i.e. You cannot do multiple transactions

### Basic Idea:
- Find the ___local___ best day to buy stock 

### Pseudo Code:
- Initally, the maxProfit is set as 0
- and the bestday to buy stock is day `0`
- As we traverse each day from the array
    - if we find a new local best day to buy stock
        - update bestday
    - else
        - compute the profit we can gain if we buy stock on the local best day to buy, and sell on the current day
        - update maxProfit if need
		
### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal:O(N)__
* __Spatial:O(1)__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int bestbuy = 0;//best day to buy stock
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int day = 1; day < prices.size(); day++) {
            if(prices[day] < prices[bestbuy]) {//if we find a better day to buy stock
                bestbuy = day;//update bestbuy
            } else {
                maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[day] - prices[bestbuy]);//update maxProfit if need
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
};
