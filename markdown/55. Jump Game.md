## [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)
### Tag: 
Array, __Greedy__
### Input: 
* An array of non-negative integers --->non-negative implys that you cannot jump backwards
    > Each element in the array represents your maximum jump you can take at that position

### Output: 
* Return if you can reach the last index

### Constrain:
* You are initially positioned at the first index of the array
___
### Basic idea:
* We are initially start from index 0;
* We denote all index between 0 and n-1 as transfer station;
* As we explore each transfer station, we check iff we can reach this transfer station,
    * if we can, figure out if we can reach destination from this transfer station;
    ```
                        e.g.   source ---> transfer station i ----> destination
					             start              via                   to
> Even though we cannot reach destination directly, but we can reach transfer station i, and that transfer station will lead us to the destination
___
### Pseudo code:
* Variable declaration and explanation:
    * declare a variable called __"farest"__, and initialize it with value 0
        > The farest we can reach from index starting point 0;
* For each transfer station ---> __O(N) AT WORST__
	* check if we can reach this transfer station
		* if we can,
			1. get the farest index we can reach if we start from this transfer station;
				* i.e. i + nums[i]
			2. if a new farest index is found,
				* update farest;
			3. check if we can reach destination after we update farest
			    * return ture
		* else ---> we cannot reach this transfer station
			* return false
		    	> no need to explore further, since it must be true that you cannot reach the following transfer station
* End For
		The algorithm above may be the most optimal solution that I could come up

### Amortized Analysis:
__Temporal: O(N) AT WORST__
__Spatial: O(1)__
### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int farest = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(farest >= i){//if you can reach i
                if(nums[i] + i > farest){//if a new farest is found
                    farest = nums[i] + i;//update it
                }
                if(farest >= nums.size()-1){//before moving to next iteration, check if we already reach destination;
                    return true;
                }
            } else {//you cannot even reach i, forget about all index after i
                    return false;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
