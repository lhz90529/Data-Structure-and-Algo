## [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/)
### Tags:
Hash Table, Stack, __Tree__
### Input:
Given a binary tree
### Output:
Return the __inorder traversal__ of its nodes' values. 
### Constrains:
* Nothing

### Basic Idea:
- ____what is inorder traversal:____ 
    - traverse in the following order: ___leftsubtree, root, right subtree___
1. __Recursive solution__ _(pretty simple)_
2. __Iterative solution__ _(a little bit chanllenging)_ 
    - Without the help of stack of function calls, we have to __explicitly construct a stack to help us emulate__ how inorder traversal is performed in recursion
    - Basically saying, we are doing exactly the same thing as we do in recursive solution;

### Pseudo Code:
- As long as we have some node un-explored, or we have some node left in stack
    - if current accessing node is not NULL
        - we save it ---> push it onto stack
        - move to left child ---> current = current's left child
    - else ---> current accessing node is NULL
        - we pop a node from stack and visit it
        - go to the right child ---> cur = poped node's right child

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:__ 
    - both recursive and iterative: O(N)
- __Spatial:__ 
    - __recursive:__ cost on stack taken by function calls
    - __iterative:__ O(1) best case and O(N) at worst 
        - __The best case is__ when each node of the given tree  __contains right child only__
        - __The worst case is__ when each node of the given tree __contains left child only__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> inorderTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        stack<TreeNode*> mystack;
        vector<int>ret;
        
        while(cur != NULL || !mystack.empty()){//as long as we have some node un-explored, or something left in stack 
            if(cur != NULL){
                mystack.push(cur);//save it
                cur = cur->left;//move to its left child
            } else {
                TreeNode* ready_to_print = mystack.top();
                mystack.pop();
                ret.push_back(ready_to_print->val);//visit it
                cur = ready_to_print->right;//move to its right child
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
        
    }
};
