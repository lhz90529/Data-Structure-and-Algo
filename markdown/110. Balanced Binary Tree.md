## [110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/)
### Tags:
Tree, Depth-first-Search
### Input:
Given a binary tree
### Output:
Determine if it is height-balanced.
### Constrains:
- For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
    > a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

### e.g.
	Example 1:
	Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

	    3
	   / \
	  9  20
	    /  \
	   15   7
	Return true.
### Basic Idea:
- For each node, check if the height of its left-child and its right-child differ by two. 

### Pseudo Code:
- __Base case:__ if the current visiting node is NULL,
	- `return 0`
- __Recursive case:__
    - Get the height of left-child
    - Get the height of right-child
    - if any child has a height equal to -1, _means that imbalance was occured_
        - `return -1`
    - Check if they differ by two
        - if they do
            - `return -1` ---> a special number to indicate that imbalance happen
        - else
            - return the height of the current visiting node
- __One important observation is that__
    - _the height of a node is equal to `1 + max(height of its left child, height of its right child)`_ <--- ___pretty important concept for this problem___

### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(N)__
* __Spatial: cost of stack taken by recursive calls__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return helper(root) == -1 ? false:true;
    }
private:
    int helper(TreeNode* root){
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            int left = helper(root->left);
            int right = helper(root->right);
            if (left == -1 || right == -1) {//if imbalance was already happened
                return -1;
            } else if (abs(left - right) > 1) {//check the heights differ by more than 1
                return -1;//-1 is a special number to indicate the happen of imbalance
            } else {//return the height of current node
                return max(left, right) + 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
