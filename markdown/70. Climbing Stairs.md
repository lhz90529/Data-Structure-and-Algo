## [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)
### Tag: 
__Dynamic Programming__
### Input: 
Given a positive integer that represents the top level of stairs
### Output: 
How many __DISTINCT ways__ to reach the top?
### Constrains:
	Each time you could either move 1 step or 2 steps upward
___
### Basic idea:
* Dynamic Programming (Bottom-up Approach)
	* __Problem:__ # of DISTINCT ways to reach level "i"
	* __Subproblems:__
		1. You can reach level "i" by move 1 step upward from level "i - 1";
		2. You can reach level "i" by moving 2 steps upward from level "i - 2"
	* __Related Subproblems:__
	    * __Problem = Subproblem1 + Subproblem2__
___
### Pseudo code:
* __Initialize a DP table__
    * __DP[0] = 1__ ---> _You are already at level 0_
    * __DP[1] = 1__ ---> _Obiviously, there is only one way to reach level 1, i.e. move 1 step upward from level 0_
    * __DP[i] for any i > 2__
	    * __DP[i] = DP[i - 1] + DP[i - 2]__ ---> _according to how we related subproblems_

Generally, this is actually kind of the __Fibonacci sequence....__
___

### Amortized Analysis:
__Temporal cost: O(N)__
__Spatial cost: O(N)__

### Follow up:
Acutally, __we can do better---> reduce spatial cost to O(1)__ 
> Because each time you compute DP[i] for any i > 2, the only thing you need is DP[i - 1] and DP[i - 2], anything else is unnecessary

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int two_level_before = 1;//two levels before current level
        int one_level_before = 1;//one level before current level
        int cur_level = 1;//the number of ditinct ways to reach current level
        for(int i = 2; i < n + 1; i++){
            cur_level = one_level_before + two_level_before;
            two_level_before = one_level_before;//update two_level_before
            one_level_before = cur_level;//update one_level_before
        }
        return cur_level;
    }
};
```
