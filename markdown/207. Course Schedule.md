## [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)
### Tags:
Depth-first-Search, Breadth-first-Search, Graph, Topological Sort
### Input:
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs,
### Output:
Determine if is possible to finish all courses?
### Constrains:
- You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

```
For example:

2, [[1,0]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

### Basic Idea:
- This problem is equivalent to say "determine if we can **linearize (topologically sort)** the graph"
- A directed graph can be linearized if and only if it contains **No cycle**
- A _cycle_ in a directed graph is **a circular path** 
- A cycle is existed if and only if there is a **back-edge**
- An edge `(u,v)` is a back-edge if `v` is `u's` ancestor
    - ___A back edge is a edge lead to a node that is visited but not completely visited___
- Thus, we reduce the problem into **"back-edge detection"**

### Pseudo Code:
1. __Create Graph `"G"`__
    - And Initialize all nodes as __"unexplored yet"__
2. __Perform DFS on graph `"G"`__
    - DFS will return false if a back-edge is detected

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal: O(|V| + |E|) ---> DFS__
- __Spatial: O(|V| + |E|)__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph = create_graph(numCourses, prerequisites);//Graph creation
        return DFS(graph);
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> create_graph(const int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses, vector<int>());
        for(pair<int,int> relation:prerequisites) {
            graph[relation.second].push_back(relation.first);
        }
        return graph;
    }
    
    bool DFS(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        vector<int> status(graph.size(), -1);//unexplored: -1    visiting:0      visited:1
        for (int v = 0; v < graph.size(); ++v) {
            if (!explore(v, graph, status)) {
                return false;
            }            
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    bool explore(const int v, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& status) {
        if (status[v] == 0) {//visiting: on the fly
            return false;
        } else if (status[v] == 1) {//completely visited
            return true;
        } else {//unexplored
            status[v] = 0;//first arrival on node v
            for (int u:graph[v]) {
                if (!explore(u, graph, status)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            status[v] = 1;//final departure from node v
            return true;
        }
    }
    
};
