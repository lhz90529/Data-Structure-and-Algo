## [202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/)
### Tags:
Hash Table, Math
### Input:
Given an integer
### Output:
Determine if it is a happy number
### Constrains:
- **Definition of happy number:**
    - A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by **the sum of the squares of its digits**, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers. 

### Example
```
19 is a happy number
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
```
### Basic Idea:
- This problem is actually equivalent to **detect a cycle in a graph** OR **do topological sort**
- Redefine the problem:
    - An number is happy number if and only if the number recursively move to next state and ultimately reach the exit state `1`
    - An number is not a happy number if the number move to a previous state that is visited before ---> a back-edge
- DAG && Topological sort

- We can use Hash Table to record all visited states so far
### Pseudo Code:
- if current state is `1` ---> `exit state`
    - return `true`
- else if we go back to a previous state
    - return `false`
- else 
    - newState = T(current state), where T() is the transformation function
    - save the current state into hash table
    - explore(newState)   

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:__
    - For happy number:
        - O(# of steps taken to reach exit state)
    - For non-happy number:
        - O(# of steps taken to detect a back edge) 
- __Spatial: same as Temporal analysis__

### Code:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> table;
        return helper(n, table);
    }
    
    bool helper(int current_state, unordered_set<int>& table) {
        if (current_state == 1) {//exit state
            return true;
        } else if (table.find(current_state) != table.end()) {//back edge 
            return false;
        } else {
            int new_state = 0;
            string s = to_string(current_state);
            for (char digit:s) {
                new_state += (digit - '0') * (digit - '0');
            }
            table.insert(current_state);//record 
            return helper(new_state, table);//explore new state
        }
    }
};
```
