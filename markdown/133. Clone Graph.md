## [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/)
### Tags:
__Depth-first-Search__, __Breadth-first-Search__, Graph
### Input:
Given an undirected graph
### Output:
Return the cloned graph
### Constrains:
- None

### Basic Idea:
- Generally saying, __Copy a node, and then copy its neighbors__
- Recursion + Hash Table + Depth-first-Search
    - __Recursion__ is responsible for copy a original node and return its copy
    - __Hash Table__ is used for keep tracking if a node has been cloned or not
    - __Depth-first-Search__ is the way we traverse the graph

### Pseudo Code:
- Construct a hash table to keep track of if a node has been cloned or not, with pair<original node, its copy>
    - if the node is cloned already,
        - return its copy 
    - else
        - clone the node
- How to clone a node?
    - For each original node
        1. copy the node 
        2. push <original node, its copy> into hash table
        3. copy its neighbor
    - __base case:__
        - when we are currently accessing a `NULL` node, no more work is needed

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:O(2N) since we visit each node twice__
    - i.e. the nature of undirected grap
    - `A<--->B` implys that `A` is neighbor of `B` and `B` is also neighbor of `A`
- __Spatial:__
    1. cost of stack taken by recursive calls
    2. HashTable ---> O(N)

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for undirected graph.
 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        static unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode*, UndirectedGraphNode*> table;
        if (node == NULL) {//base case 1: NULL node
            return NULL;
        } else if (table.find(node) != table.end()) {//base case 2: the node is cloned already
            return table[node];
        } else {//unvisited node
            table[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);//clone the node
            for(UndirectedGraphNode* neighbor:node->neighbors) {//clone its neighbors
                table[node]->neighbors.push_back(cloneGraph(neighbor));
            }
            return table[node];//return copy
        }
    }
};
```

### Another way to approach this problem ---> Breadth-first-Search
### Basic idea:
- You start with any arbitary `source node`
- You are traversing the graph ___level by level___
    - you visit all nodes that are 0 distance away from `source node`, i.e. the `source node` itself
    - then you visit all nodes that are 1 distance away from `source node`
    - then you visit all nodes that are 2 distances away from `source node` 
    - _and so on..._


- __One important observation learned from `CS106`__
    >  _If you are trying to search the path to a particular node, `BFS` will always give you the shortest path because its nature: __level by level___ 
    
- __Prove by contradiction__
1. Suppose BFS give you a path from source to that particular node with distance `d = i`, which imply the node is on level `i`
2. Assume you can find a shorter path with distance `d < i`, which means the node is on  level of _`l < i`_
3. The contradiction is: If the node is on level of  _`l < i`_, BFS will definitely find the node on that level and return the path, thus never go to level `i`

### Pseudo Code
- Constuct a Hash Table to keep track of if a particular node is cloned or not
    - with _`pair<original node, its corresponding copy>`_
    - If a particular node is cloned, you should be able to find the node in the table
- Construct a queue to keep track of ___nodes that are visited already but unfinished___
    - __Each time a node is visited, it will be pushed into the queue__
    - when a node's all neighbors are visited, we define the node as ___finished___ and poped it out of the queue
- We start from a `source node`
    - copy it
    - push the pair into table 
    - push into queue
- While queue is not empty
    - get the front node of the queue
    - visit all its neighbors
    - pop out the node;
- End While

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:O(N)__
- __Spatial:O(N)__

 *     int label;

 */
class Solution {
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        if ( node == NULL) {//special case
            return NULL;
        }
        unordered_map<UndirectedGraphNode*, UndirectedGraphNode*> table;
        queue<UndirectedGraphNode*> myqueue;
        table[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);//visit source node
        myqueue.push(node);//push into queue
        while (!myqueue.empty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode* current = myqueue.front();//visited but unfinished node
            for (UndirectedGraphNode* neighbor: current->neighbors) {
                if(table.find(neighbor) == table.end()) {//for each unvisited neighbor
                    table[neighbor] = new UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor->label);//visit
                    myqueue.push(neighbor);
                }
                table[current]->neighbors.push_back(table[neighbor]);//clone the edge
            }
            myqueue.pop();
        }
        return table[node];
    }
