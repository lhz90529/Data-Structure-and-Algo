## [112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/)
### Tags:
Tree, Depth-first-Search
### Input:
Given a binary tree and a sum
### Output:
Determine if the tree has __a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum__
### Constrains:
- None

### e.g.
    For example:
    Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
    
                  5
                 / \
                4   8
               /   / \
              11  13  4
             /  \      \
            7    2      1
    return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
### Basic Idea:
- ___recursion___

### Pseudo Code:
- __base case:__
    1. if the current visiting node is NULL,
        - `return false` ---> _we reach the leaf node and still have not found a path_
    2. if the current visiting node is __a leaf node__, and __the amount of work left is equal to the value of current visiting node__,
        - `return true` ---> _we find a path from root to leaf that sums to the the given number_
- __recursive case:__ 
    - check if there is a path from its left child to leaf node that sums to `input sum - the value of current visiting node` __OR__ there is a path from its right child to leaf node that sums to `input sum - the value of current visiting node`

### Amortized Analysis:
* __Temporal: O(N)__
* __Spatial: cost of stack taken by recursive calls__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return false;
        } else if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL && root->val == sum) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return hasPathSum(root->left, sum - root->val) || hasPathSum(root->right, sum - root->val);
        }
    }
};
