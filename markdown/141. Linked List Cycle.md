## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)
### Tags:
Linked List, Two pointers
### Input:
Given a linked list
### Output:
Determine if it has a cycle in it
### Constrains:
- None

### Basic Idea:
> Everything is about the story of [The Tortoise and hare](https://mitchellkember.com/blog/post/tortoise-and-hare/)
- __If there is a cycle in the competition, tort and hare will eventually meet at some points__

### Pseudo Code:
- __Source:__ `head` of linked list
- __Destination:__ `NULL`
- Set _Mr.tort_ and _Ms.hare_ at __the starting line `head`__
    - __Speed of _Mr.tort_:__ move one step each time
    - __Speed of _Ms.hare_:__ move two steps each time
- As long as _Ms.hare_ __cannot reach destination in one move__
    - tort move
    - hare move
    - check if they are currently at the same location
        - `return true` ---> cycle is detected
- End of loop
---> at this particular timeline, hare reach `destination`
- return false


### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal: __
- __Spatial: __

### Code:
```c++

 *     int val;

 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}

    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if(head == NULL) {
            return false;
        }
        /*Welcome to the Trail Running Competition
        starting: head
        destination: NULL

        Speed of Ms.hare: 2
        */
        
        ListNode* tort = head;//set both players at the starting line
        ListNode* hare = head;
        
        while (hare->next != NULL && hare->next->next != NULL) {//as long as Ms.hare cannot reach destination in one move
            tort = tort->next;//tort move
            hare = hare->next->next;//hare move
            if (tort == hare) {//they meet
               return true; //cycle is detected 
            }
        }
        //they never meet and hare reach the destination
        return false;
    }
};

### In-Depth
![begin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhz90529/Data-Structure-and-Algo/master/pictures/begin.png)
- Mr.Tort and Ms.Hare start at the same line
- After Mr.Tort move `m` steps
    - ___Mr.Tort will be at the entry of the cycle___
    - ___Ms.Hare must be at some point in the cycle since Ms.Hare move so fast___
    - result is shown on figure below
![in-cycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lhz90529/Data-Structure-and-Algo/master/pictures/in-cycle.png)
- Now the first thing we need to prove is that they will definitely meet before tort move an entire cycle
    - Think about in this way
    -if the maximum distance between hare and tort is `x` ---> acutally they already meet
    -After tort moves `x` steps, hare moves `2x` steps, they meet again
- Thus we can have two following conclusions:
    - __As long as there is a cycle in the linked list, tort and hare will meet eventually__
    - __As long as tort move to the entry of the cycle, they will meet before tort move an entire cycle__
- Now we try to find where they meet,
- `steps`: number of steps that tort moves when they meet
- Then we have: `0 + steps = (a + 2*steps) % x`
- `steps = a + 2*steps - x`
- `steps = x - a`
- That is, if 
    - tort at the entry of cycle
    - hare is at some point `a` away from entry
    - they will meet when tort move `x - a` steps and hare move `2 * (x - a)` steps

- Thus, the total move of tort is `m + x - a`, where `a = m % x`
