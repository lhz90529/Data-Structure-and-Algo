## [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/)
### Tags:
Tree, Depth-first-Search
### Input:
Given a binary tree
### Output:
Find the maximum path sum
### Constrains:
- For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree ___along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.___

### Basic Idea:
- Go to where you can gain benifit

### Pseudo Code:
- `if` the maximum path to reach the `left-child` and the maximum path to reach `right-child` are both non-positive, there is no benifit you could earn if you go either direction. The best thing you can do is stay on the root
- `else if` the maximum path to the `left-child` is non-positive, which imply the maximum path to reach the `right-child` is positive. The best you can do is go right
- `else if` the maximum path to the `right-child` is non-positive, which imply the maximum path to reach the `left-child` is positive. The best you can do is go left.
- `else` go both directions ---> _i.e. from left via root to right_

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:O(N) ---> Traverse the whole tree__
- __Spatial:cost of stack taken by recursive calls__

### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int ret = INT_MIN;
        helper(root, ret);
        return ret;
    }
    
    int helper(TreeNode* root, int& ret) {
        if (root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            int left = helper(root->left, ret);
            int right = helper(root->right, ret);
            if (left <= 0 && right <= 0) {//The best option for you is simply to stay on the root
                ret = max(ret,root->val);
                return root->val;
            } else if (left <= 0) {//The best option for you is to go right
                ret = max(ret, root->val + right);
                return root->val + right;
            } else if (right <= 0) {//The best option for you is to go left
                ret = max(ret, root->val + left);
                return root->val + left;
            } else {//Go both directions
                ret = max(ret, root->val + left + right);
                return root->val + max(left, right);//but only return the best path to the root
            }
        }
    }
};
