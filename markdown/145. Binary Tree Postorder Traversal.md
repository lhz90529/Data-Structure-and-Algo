## [145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/description/)
### Tags:
Tree, Stack
### Input:
Given a binary tree
### Output:
Return its postorder traversal
### Constrains:
- _Can you do it both __recursively__ and __iteratively?___

### Basic Idea:
- ___What is postorder traversal?___
    1. visit its left-child
    2. visit its right-child
    3. visit the node
- When we are accessing a particular `non-NULL` node, _we save it (i.e. push it into stack)_ ___since we cannot visit it right away___, and we first move to its left child
- When we reach a NULL node, we go back to its parent (i.e. the top of stack). Note that we don't pop the node yet since we haven't finish visiting its right child if it has unvisted right child

### Pseudo Code:
- __Important parameters:__
    - Stack
    - visited ---> a pointer point to most recently visited node
    - current: current accessing node
- As long as the current accessing node is not NULL __OR__ stack is not empty (i.e. there are undone works)
    - if current is not NULL
        - save it
        - go to its left child
    - else 
        - get its parent ---> i.e. top of stack
        - check if parent has no right child or its right child was visited
            - visit parent
            - pop parent from stack
            - update variable `visited`
        - else ---> parent has unvisited right child
            - go to its right child
- End of loop

### Amortized Analysis:
- __Temporal:O(N)__
- __Spatial:O(Height of the tree)__
### Code:
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

        TreeNode* current = root;
        TreeNode* visited = NULL;
        while (current != NULL || !mystack.empty() ) {
            if (current != NULL) {
               mystack.push(current);//save it
                current = current->left;
            } else {//left subtree is visited
                TreeNode* temp = mystack.top();//get parent
                //if parent has no right child OR
                //parent's right child is already visited
                if (temp->right == NULL || temp->right == visited) {
                    ret.push_back(temp->val);//visit it 
                    visited = temp;//update visited
                    mystack.pop();
                } else {
                    current = temp->right;
                }
            }
        }
        return ret;
        
    }
