15. 3Sum
Tag: Array, Two Pointers

Input: an array 
Output: all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero
Constrain: solution must not contain duplicate triplets

Basic idea:
	Key step: sort the array
		benifits1: duplicate number will be clustered;
		benifits2: can use "Two Pointers" technic;
	Key concept: "Two Pointers" technic
Pseudo code:
1: Sort the array ---> Temporal: O(NlogN)
2: For each number x in the sorted array ---> O(N)
		Using "Two Pointers" technic to check if there is pair that sum up to -x; ---> O(N)	
		"Two Pointers" technic's important concerns:
			1: the first pointer always start with index just right after x;
			2: When either first pointer or last pointer need to be moved, it will move until a new value is discovered; 
		we go to next iteration of the loop;
		Note: if next number is still with value x, skip it;
	End for
Temporal: O(NlogN) + O(N) * O(N) = O(N^2);
Spatial: O(1);
