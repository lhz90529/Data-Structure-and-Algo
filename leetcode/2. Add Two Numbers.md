## [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)
### Tag:
Linked List, Math
### Input:  
head1 and head2: the head of two non-empty lists;
### Output: 
return the head of a linked list that represents the addition of the number represented by list1 and the number represented by list2;

### Example:
```
eg:
	2->4->3   <--- list1
+	5->6->4   <--- list2
----------------
	7->0->8	  <--- returned list
explanation:
	2 + 5 = 7;
	4 + 6 = 10; ---> give carry = 1 to the next level;
	3 + 4 + 1 = 8;
```
### Basic idea:
Traverse the 2 lists and add corresponding number, __Important parameter: carry__

### Pseudo code:
1. __Parameters initialization:__
l1 point to the head of list1;

l2 point to the head of list2;

ret: a newly creat list with dummy variable 0, like "ret: 0->NULL"
tail: always point to the last Link node of list "ret";
carry = 0;
2. __As long as we haven't traverse through the 2 list or the carry is non-zero__
		val1 = l1->val; special case: val1 = 0 if the l1 = NULL; 
		val2 = l2->val; special case: val2 = 0 if the l2 = NULL; 
		tail->next = a new link node with value  "(val1 + val2 + carry) % 10"
		
		before move to next iteration of the loop, update info:
		carry will be used for next level is "(val1 + val2 + carry) % 10"
		current = current->next;
		move l1 if it's not NULL; move l2 if it's not NULL;
3. __return ret->next__
		since the first link node is dummy node '0';
