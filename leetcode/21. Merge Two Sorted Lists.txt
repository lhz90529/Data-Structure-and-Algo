21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Tag:Linked List
Input: two pointers l1, and l2 point to the head of two sorted lists;
Output: a pointer point to the head of a sorted list which is the merge of 2 input lists;

Key idea:
	The idea from merge sort algo

Pseudo coede:
Parameter Declaration and Initialization:
	ret: creat a new list with dummy variable 0;
	tail: always point to the tail of list 'ret'
Compare:
	while(l1 is not NULL and l2 is not NULL) ---> O(N)
		check who is the small one: l1->val vs l2->val
		the small value will be append at the back of return list
		the pointer with small value will move forward one step
	end while
Clean the remaining:
	if there is anything remained either from list1 or list2, append them at the back of return list
	
return ret->next; since the first Link node is a dummy node '0';

Temporal: O(N) where N is the sum of total number of node in list1 and list2;
Spatial: O(1);
